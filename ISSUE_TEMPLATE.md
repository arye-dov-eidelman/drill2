Disregard this message if you're filing a feature request.

Here's a list of things to check before sending in a bug report:

- Make sure the issue hasn't been reported yet: https://github.com/gronostajo/drill2/issues.
- Make sure the title describes actual problem. *"Explanations don't show up"* is good. *"Bug in question #32"* is bad.
- When reporting issue in a specific question bank, include it in your bug report. Try to prepare a Minimal, Complete, Verifiable example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve
- Screenshots may be helpful. Just hit `Ctrl`+`V` to upload them.
- Before posting a part of question bank make sure you really want it floating in the public web. Consider using Lorem ipsum instead of real text: http://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/

This block will not show in your issue. You may remove it.
