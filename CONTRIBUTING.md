# Contributing to Drill 2

So you want to contribute? That's great! Your interest in making Drill 2 better is appreciated. This document contains some guidelines for everyone who's eager to help.

## Reporting issues

Drill 2 should be considered a beta. *Bugs happen*. Please report any issues you may spot.

Here's a list of things to check before sending in a bug report:

- Make sure the issue hasn't been reported yet. Reported bugs are [listed on GitHub](https://github.com/gronostajo/drill2/issues).
- Make sure the title describes actual problem. *"Explanations don't show up"* is good. *"Bug in question #32"* is bad.
- When reporting an issue that manifests itself in a specific question bank, include this question in your bug report. Try to prepare a [Minimal, Complete, Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).
- Screenshots are very helpful. Just hit `Ctrl`+`V` to upload them.
- Before posting a part of question bank make sure you really want it floating in the public net. Consider using [Lorem ipsum](http://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/) instead of real text.

## Proposing enhancements

I'm always open for new ideas. If you know how to enhance Drill 2 or need a feature that's currently missing, feel free to post your idea as an issue.

Try to be as clear as possible. You can include a sketch of the new feature if you want to.

## Code contributions

You want to patch a nasty bug or develop a new feature? That's great! [Fork Drill 2](https://github.com/gronostajo/drill2/fork) to create a copy you can work on. Add some magical bytes and create a pull request when you're ready to roll out. I'll review your code and consider integrating it in the main codebase.
